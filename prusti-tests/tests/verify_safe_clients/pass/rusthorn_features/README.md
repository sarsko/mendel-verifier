This folder contains programs taken from [rust-horn](https://github.com/hopv/rust-horn/tree/master/toplas2021).
The purpose of these tests is to check that the language features supported by rust-horn are supported by Prusti as well.
The verification outcome of Prusti is not meaningful; we would need to add contracts to compare the completeness.
